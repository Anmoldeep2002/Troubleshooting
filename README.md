<h1>Troubleshooting (Account Lockout, Password Reset, Enable Account)</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this section, I will go over typical troubleshooting steps like unlocking accounts, resetting passwords, and enabling previously disabled accounts. These actions will all be conducted for John's account, demonstrating my ability to fix typical IT issues.</p>


<br />

<h2>Step-by-Step Walk-Through:</h2>


<p align="center"> 
STEP 1 (ACCOUNT LOCKOUT): </p> 

<p align="center">In this scenario, John's account gets locked out due to an excessive number of login attempts. John attempted to log in several times, but he was unsuccessful, and the account was locked because of the newly implemented lockout group policy. I've previously specified a lockout group policy of 5 unsuccessful login attempts, after which the account would get temporarily disabled.</p>

<p align="center">As you can see, John's account is now disabled due to multiple attempted login attempts. Now, whenever he tries to login, he receives an error notice, as shown in the image above.</p>

<p align="center">I'm now on the helpdesk account, and the first step in unlocking John's account is to access Active Directory Users and Computers. From there, I navigate to John's account via the HR folder.</p>

<p align="center">Now I right-click on the account to view its settings and make the necessary changes. I then navigate to the "PROPERTIES" area to access more account settings.</p>

<p align="center">This is the properties section of John's account. As you can see, I have many options to choose from, but in this case, I am interested in the "Account" section, so I click on it.</p>

<p align="center">From here, I tick the box that prompts me to unlock the account. As you can see in the image above, I tick the box and then click "Apply" to apply the modifications. I then click the "OK" button to proceed to the next step.</p>

<p align="center">As you can see, John can now log in to his account. I've completed the account unlocking procedure successfully and got his account back up and running.</p>

<p align="center"> 
STEP 2 (PASSWORD RESET): </p> 

<p align="center">In this scenario, John has forgotten his login information and is unable to access into his account. He doesn't want his account to be locked again, so he contacted the administrator to reset the password.</p>

<br/>

<p align="center">

<p align="center">As you can see, John is unable to connect and receives an error popup indicating that the password entered is incorrect.</p>


<br />
<br />

<p align="center">

<p align="center">The first step in resetting the password would be to access Active Directory Users and Computers via the helpdesk account. From here, I can reset John's password and allow him to access his account again. I locate John's account, which is in the HR folder.</p>


<br />
<br />

<p align="center">

<p align="center">I right-click on the account to open the account settings, then select "RESET PASSWORD".</p>


<br />
<br />

<p align="center">

<p align="center">As you can see, I am required to provide a new password for John's account. I then type a new password and click "OK" to successfully reset his password. The second image shows that the password has been successfully reset.</p>
